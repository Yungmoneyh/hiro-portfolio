About This Project:  

This is the project and I had to create a portfolio website and I used both HTML and CSS.  

It has a total of four pages and it includes the homepage, project page, about me page, and also contact page.

The website includes the navigation links, headers aswell as footers, pictures, a video, and a contact form.  

I did the code so it works on different devices including the desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.  

 

Original Work:  

All of the code was written by me.  

I only used the lecture notes provided and taught to me from class to help me complete this code.

I didn't use any outside source for any of these codes and I used my knowledge from the lectures and tutorials.

 

All files in this project:  

- website.html (Home page)  

- about.html (About Me page)  

- project.html (Projects page)  

- contact.html (Contact page with form)  

- main.css (main styling)

How to View:  

In order to view the page you have to open the website.html code and open to link server and it'll open the browser.

Once you go onto any of the pages you have to click any one of the links at the top of the page to go to any of the other pages or other HTML files, which includes the about me page, contact page, project page aswell as the main homepage.

In the code you can also resize the window to see how it looks on different devices such as mobile devices (smaller device), tablets (medium size device) and desktop (bigger device).

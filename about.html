        <!-- Introduction of myself (Paragraph) -->
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Hirosan Ravichandran</strong>. 
        I am studying Networking and IT Security at Ontario Tech University.
        I have big dreams on getting in the cybersecurity field as I know it is a rapidly growing field.
        I love working on network labs and cybersecurity exercises and this is almost a full-time hobby.
        I want to help organizations strengthen their entire defensive system against cyber threats. Cybersecurity is rapidly growing and  
        I know learning and getting in this field is one of the best decisions in the long run. 

        <!-- About my education (header) -->

        <p>Ontario Tech University | 2024 - 2028</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbies outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and going out to eat,
             I also love playing basketball and staying active. I also have a really strong mindset, where I was always into taking risks
              at a young age and running different businesses and taking major risks with crypto.  I like keeping up with new tech tools and trend and these hobbies
               help me balance schoolwork and other stress while still doing the things I enjoy. </p>

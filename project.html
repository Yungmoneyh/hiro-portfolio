    <section>

        <!-- Header for HTML5 and CSS3 -->
        <h2>Portfolio Website: HTML5 and CSS3</h2>
        <!-- Description for HTML5 and CSS3 project -->
        <p>I coded and built this personal portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3. 
        The website has a number of pages with semantic tags, responsive layout, and 
        consistent styling. This project helped me solidify my front-end skills and learn about
        structuring an actual website. It also demonstrates the potential for hosting a project live on GitHub Pages.

        <h2>Networking lab: LAN and Routing</h2>
        <!-- Description for LAN and Routing project -->
        <p>I am studying Networking and IT Security and I've completed many labs and projects that taught me different skills. 
            One of them was setting up a LAN in Cisco Packet Tracer. I worked on assigning IP addresses, creating routing,
            and testing connections across multiple different devices. I also troubleshooted issues like wrong subnets
            and routing loops, which helped me gain practical experience and more knowledge in networking.

        <h2>Programming in Pycharm: Encryption and Decryption</h2>
        <!-- Description for Encryption and Decryption -->
        <p>I also worked on a project in PyCharm Community Edition where I created a Python program for encryption
            and decryption. The program allowed the user to type in text and then either scramble it or
            change it back using a simple method. This project helped me improve my Python skills and 
            showed me how programming can be used in cybersecurity.</p>

    <section>
        <!-- Header for Spoofing Attacks-->
        <h2>Computer Security: Spoofing Attacks</h2>
        <!-- Description for Spoofing Attacks -->
        <p>This has to be one of the coolest projects I have done and it was all about spoofing. I explored multiple
           attacks that used spoofing through VirtualBox, Kali Linux, and Wireshark. I practiced MAC address
           spoofing to mimic identity changes within a network, created a cloned website through NGINX to mimic web spoofing, and
           altered the DNS settings to mimic the redirecting nature of cache poisoning. This project gave me hands-on, real-world
           practice working with cyber attacks as well as countermeasures.</p>

    <!-- Section for VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing -->
    <section>
        <!-- Header for VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing -->
        <h2>Advanced Networking: VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing</h2>
        <!-- Description for VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing -->
        <p>In this project, I set up VLAN's on multiple switches to split a larger network into smaller parts.
            I also configured inter-VLAN routing on a router so the different departments could still communicate safely.
            This lab helped me understand advanced switching, how network separation works, and how it improves both
            performance and security in business networks.</p>
